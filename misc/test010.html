<pre>
Yes I now you're never free on Saturday
And I know I couldn't see you anyway
Oh oh oh you told me we could have been lovers
Lovers lovers lovers
For you-I can run away and sail the seven seas
For you-I can give all up and get down on my knees
For you-oh oh oh I told to other boys I'm free never
Ever never ever

Come on your silly life is over
Now it's time to give me affection
I say come on so pick up your receiver
There's my number at your home dialing it on the phone

It's just a matter of
Telephone call me tonight call me today
Telephone without your voice no I can't stay
Telephone I've gotta a message for my love
Bad operator no communication
Telephone call me today call me tonight
Telephone without your love I can't survive
Telephone jealousy wonders where you are
Bad operator no communication

Got to know the way you pass your Saturdays
Got to know what crosses your mind anyway
Oh oh oh can't keep me hanging baby forever
Ever ever never
For you-I don't sleep don't eat don't talk to anyone
For you-with my friend a don't go to the cinema
For you-oh oh oh all my emotions run into fever
Fever fever fever
