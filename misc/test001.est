My name is Mikio Hirabayashi.  I'm the author of Hyper Estraier.
Hyper Estraier is a full-text search system. It works as with Google, but based on peer-to-peer architecture.  Using Hyper Estraier, we can construct a large-scaled search engine with inexpensive computers.
Hyper Estraier provides not only user interface but also application programming interface.  The UI is web interface and users can enjoy full-text search with a web browser.  The API is available in such languages as C and some scripting languages.  Hyper Estraier is the successor of Estraier (see http://estraier.sourceforge.net).  While Estraier uses morphological analysis to extract search words, Hyper Estraier uses N-gram analysis.  That is, most natural languages are supported and recall rate of search is improved.
